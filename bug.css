The following CSS rule causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

The issue arises when the `div` elements do not have a defined height, or the parent container is not explicitly set.  In this case, the `float: left;` property may not render correctly and result in unexpected layout issues, such as elements not displaying properly or overlapping.
